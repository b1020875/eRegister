eRegister
=========

This is my application for the Attendance Applicaiton.

How the Application Works
=========================

Start up the project and you will be greeted with the log in screen.
A user will log in with their ID and use the standard password that all users have been given for the development and testing of the application.

Example:
Instructor Login-I1234
Password-password

Student Login-S3425
Password-password

If an instructor has logged onto the screen, they will have the ability to look at a list of classes, crete a register and add a student's registration to a register.
If a student logs on, they will only have the ability to add their registration to a register.
